# Dynamics.NET

Extensions for runtime reflection and structural induction. The following
features are provided out of the box:

 * generic deep copying
 * precise type mutability checks
 * precise type circularity checks
 * identifying fields that are compiler-generated
 * finding the compiler-generated fields for auto properties

So basically, functions that are useful for serialization, runtime type
and code generation and similar applications where analysing type
structure is useful.
